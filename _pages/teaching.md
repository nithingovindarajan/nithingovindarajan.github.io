1. At KU Leuven I have been a co-instructor for ``Numerieke modellering & benadering'' (*in Dutch!*) run by prof. Lieven de Lathauwer and  Samaey Giovanni in the second semester of academic years 2019/2020 and 2021/2022. I am scheduled to be a co-instructor again in 2023/2024. My responbility was primarily to cover the lectures on *eigenvalue algorithms*. The slides of my lectures may be obtained from this [zip file](/assets/zipfiles/slides_numerieke_modellering_benadering_nithin.zip). 
2. At KU Leuven I have been a teaching assistant for the course "Numerieke wiskunde" run by prof. Koen Van Den Abeele in the first semester of academic years 2019/2020, 2020/2021, 2021/2022.
3. I have organized and co-lectured the graduate level [SOCN](https://sites.uclouvain.be/socn/) course "[Fast algorithms for dense structured matrices](https://sites.uclouvain.be/socn/drupal/socn/node/213)" together with Prof. Shivkumar Chandrasekaran. To access the course material, I refer the interested reader to the [course page]( https://nithingovindarajan.github.io/SOCN-Fast-algorithms-for-dense-structured-matrices/).
3. I have independently taught the course "Numerical Mathematics" in the second semester of academic year 2018/2019 at [Amsterdam University College](https://www.auc.nl/).
4. As a PhD student, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses at UC Santa Barbara:
