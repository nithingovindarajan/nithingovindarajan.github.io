#### Research code
1. **Fast Macaulay null space algorithm (Julia).** An efficient algorithm to compute null spaces of Macaulay matrices of bivariate polynomial systems. As discussed in ["A fast algorithm for computing Macaulay null spaces of bivariate polynomial systems"](https://ftp.esat.kuleuven.be/pub/stadius/ida/reports/23-16.pdf), the null space of the matrix is obtained by converting the Macaulay matrix into a Cauchy-like matrix and using the Schur algorithm (with approximate total pivoting) to compute a rank-revealing LU factorization. ([Repository](https://github.com/nithingovindarajan/Fast-Macaulay-Nullspace/tree/main))
2. **Spline-based separable expansions (Matlab).** An implementation of a supervised learning framework that employs splines with sums of separable functions to perform both regression and classification tasks. As covered in the paper ["Regression and classification with spline-based separable expansions"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2022.688496/full), the discretization of the approximant by both a B-spline and a low rank polyadic decomposition result in an efficient procedure for approximating functions in many variables. ([Download link Tensorlab+](https://www.tensorlabplus.net/papers/govindarajan2022cpdspline.html))
3. **CSS matrices (Julia).** Code to construct and solve Cycle Semi-Separable (CSS) matrices. As discussed in the paper ["Minimal rank completions for overlapping blocks"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024379521002469), the construction involves solves solving a minimum rank completion problem. ([Repository](https://gitlab.com/nithin.govindarajn/sss-and-css-solvers/))
4. **Periodic Approximation (Matlab).** An implementation of the periodic approximation technique for computing spectra of the Koopman operator for measure-preserving dynamical systems. The theory behind these methods are discussed in the companion papers ["On the approximation of Koopman spectra of measure-preserving flows"](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1282908) and ["On the approximation of Koopman spectra for measure preserving transformations"](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/18M1175094). The code base caters both to the discrete-time and continuous-time case, but is limited to systems that only preserve the Lebesgue measure. ([Repository](https://gitlab.com/nithin.govindarajn/koopman-periodic-approximation))
5. **Hybrid Pendulum (Matlab)**  Code associated with the paper ["An operator-theoretic viewpoint to non-smooth dynamical systems: Koopman analysis of a hybrid pendulum"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7799266) to plot Koopman eigenfunctions of the Hybrid pendulum. ([Repository](https://github.com/nithingovindarajan/Hybrid-Pendulum-Experiments))

#### Packages
1. **PyTensorlab (Python).** I am currently involved in a huge undertaking to translate the [Tensorlab](https://www.tensorlab.net/) software package in Matlab to Python. This is software package for computing tensor decompositions (e.g., CPD, multi-linear SVD, LMLRA). I am one of the main contributing developers. (IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE)
2. **SSSMatrices (Julia).** Computational routines for Sequentially Semi-Separable (SSS) matrices. The package allows one to convert dense matrix into SSS representation, add SSS representations, and solve systems involving SSS representations.
