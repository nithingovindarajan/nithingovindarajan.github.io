I am postdoctoral researcher at the  [Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics (STADIUS)](...)  in [KU Leuven](...). My advisor here is Prof. [Lieven De Lathauwer](...), whose research is on the development of tensor tools for mathematical engineering. My current [research activities](/publications) are also geared towards the design and implementation of *efficient* (multi-)linear numerical methods in applications broadly ranging from signal processing, machine learning, to solving systems of polynomial equations. 

I received my Ph.D. in 2018 at the Mechanical Engineering department at [UC Santa Barbara](https://me.ucsb.edu/). I was co-supervised by Prof. [Igor MeziÄ‡](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/igor-mezic) that works in [dynamical systems and nonlinear control](https://mgroup.me.ucsb.edu/) and Prof. [Shivkumar Chandrasekaran](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/shiv-chandrasekaran) of the [Scientific Computing group](http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu/index.html). The focus of my Ph.D. research was primarily on the computation of Koopman spectra of measure-preserving dynamical systems.
