I am a [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00129836) at the  [Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics (STADIUS)](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) group at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/). I work in the field of (numerical) linear algebra, with a special focus on *fast algorithms for structured matrices and tensors*.  I am interested in applications in a diverse number of fields ranging from dynamical systems and control, signal processing, machine learning, PDEs, to solving systems of polynomial equations. 

My Postdoctoral advisor is Prof. [Lieven De Lathauwer](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?id=22). I received my Ph.D. in 2018 at the Mechanical Engineering Department of [UC Santa Barbara](https://me.ucsb.edu/). The focus of my Ph.D. research was primarily on the computation of Koopman spectra of measure-preserving dynamical systems. I was co-supervised by Prof. [Igor MeziÄ‡](https://me.ucsb.edu/people/igor-mezic) who works in [dynamical systems and nonlinear control](https://mgroup.me.ucsb.edu/) and Prof. [Shivkumar Chandrasekaran](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/shiv-chandrasekaran) of the [Scientific Computing group](http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu/index.html).
